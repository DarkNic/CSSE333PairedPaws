	CSSE 220 &ndash; BallWorlds 
</h1>

<!--Work on this exercise in the pairs assigned by your instructor, using good principles of Pair Programming.-->
Feel free to ask questions of your instructor, student assistants and classmates as desired.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<h2>
	Goals 
</h2>
The goals of this exercise are to: 
<ul>
	<li> Learn about informal use of UML to communicate and brainstorm. </li>
	<li> Learn about inheritance and its benefits. </li>
	<li> Gain more practice implementing interfaces. </li>
	<li> Learn about visibility modifiers </li>
</ul>
<h2>
	The Exercise 
</h2>
<h3>
	Instructions Part 1 - Demo and Basic Specification 
</h3>
Your instructor will demo BallWorlds and discuss the basic spec with you. 
<h3>
	Instructions Part 2 - Design 
</h3>
<p>
	UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams are used primarily for two purposes. First, project designers use them during the <b>design phase</b> of larger projects to brainstorm relationships between classes. Second, they can then be used for <b>communication</b>: to convey the design to the implementors of the project. We are using UML for the second purpose here. 
</p>
<p>
	Study <a href="BallWorldsUML.pdf">this diagram</a> and answer the questions below. (Your instructor may have had you answer these in class or on a separate worksheet. If so, your work on this part is done.) 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>What class starts the program?</li>
	<li>What two kinds of objects does that class create?</li>
	<li> What are the classes of the three objects instantiated by a <em>SimulationPanel</em>? </li>
	<li>What three interfaces are implemented by <em>BallWorld</em>?</li>
	<li>What three interfaces are implemented by <em>Ball</em>?</li>
	<li>Any class that implements the <em>Drawable</em> interface must have at least what two methods?</li>
	<li>What five classes must you implement for this program?</li>
</ol>
<h3>
	Instructions Part 3 - Get the starting code 
</h3>
<!--<p>
	Connect to your team repository to get the starting BallWorlds code. Your teams and repositories are listed on Moodle.
</p>
-->
<!--If you are working solo, it will be in your personal repos; otherwise it is in a repos of the format:

<p>http://svn.cs.rose-hulman.edu/repos/csse220-200910-username1-username2</p>
 (where the 2 usernames are alphabetized).
-->
<p><strong>This is an individual assignment. However, we encourage you to work 
closely with a single partner of your choice</strong> who you identify in the 
comments at the top of your Pulsar class.</p> 

<p>Refer back to earlier projects if you need a reminder about how to connect.</p> 

<h3>
	Instructions Part 4 - Implement basic code for each kind of ball 
</h3>
<p>
	You will write this project in stages. First you&rsquo;ll get the basic animation working for each kind of ball. Then you&rsquo;ll iteratively add additional features to the program. 
</p>
<p>To get you started, here are some videos that show each ball in action
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/Ap1Lnghik2M">Pulsar</a>   </li>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/6KzL4wGZnv4">Mover</a>    </li>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/9FkPXm0CTT8">Bouncer</a>  </li>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/7NVhO_oe3K4">Exploder</a> </li>

  </ul>
</p>
<p>
	In the stages below, we&rsquo;ve included some questions to guide your thinking. You don&rsquo;t need to answer the questions in writing, but answering them will help you think about how to implement the stage. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Note: You must take full advantage of inheritance in this project to get full credit!</strong> 
</p>
<h4>
	Stage 1: Pulsar 
</h4>
<p>
	A <em>Pulsar</em> is a ball that appears on the screen and smoothly varies from white to black and back again, repeatedly. It should appear in a random location with any reasonable size. 
</p>
<ol>
	<li> A note in BallWorld&rsquo;s UML class diagram indicates that every Ball must have a constructor that takes a <em>BallEnvironment</em> object. Per the UML diagram, what method of <em>BallEnvironment</em> might be useful for determining the size of the ball&rsquo;s world? </li>
	<li>Look at the UML diagram for <em>Ball</em>. How many methods does it require that its subclasses implement?</li>
	<li> Based on the interfaces <em>Ball</em> implements, how many methods does it promise that it (or its subclasses) will implement?</li>
	<li> Which of the interface methods will Ball implement? Which does it leave for its subclasses?</li>
	<li>The framework calls <em>Ball</em>&rsquo;s <em>timePassed()</em> method every 10 ms or so. Looking at the <strong>code</strong> for <em>Ball</em>, what methods does <em>Ball</em>&rsquo;s <em>timePassed()</em> call? </li>
	<li>What methods must <em>Pulsar</em> implement?</li>
	<li> What fields should a <em>Pulsar</em> have? </li>
</ol>
<p>
	Commit your work to the repository now! 
</p>
<h4>
	Stage 2: Mover 
</h4>
<p>
	A <em>Mover</em> should start in the exact middle of its world (regardless of its world&rsquo;s size). Each Mover should have its own fixed velocity that is set at random when the Mover is constructed. The random velocity should be in any reasonable range that includes all directions (not just the &ldquo;positive&rdquo; direction). Each new ball type&rsquo;s color should be different from colors of the Ball types that you already implemented. 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Recall that the framework calls <em>Ball</em>&rsquo;s <em>timePassed()</em> method every 10 ms or so. What methods does <em>Ball</em>&rsquo;s <em>timePassed()</em> call again? </li>
	<li>What methods must <em>Mover</em> implement?</li>
	<li><em>Ball</em> provides a couple of protected helper methods for use by its subclasses. Which of these might be useful for implementing <em>Mover</em>?</li>
	<li> What fields should a <em>Mover</em> have?</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Commit your work to the repos (last reminder, after this, you are on your own). 
</p>
<h4>
	Stage 3: Bouncer 
</h4>
<p>
	A <em>Bouncer</em> should behave just like a <em>Mover</em>, except that it bounces off the edges of its world. Remember, each new ball type needs to be a different new color. 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>From the UML diagram, what class must <em>Bouncer</em> extend?</li>
	<li><em>Ball</em> provides a couple of protected helper methods for use by its subclasses. Which of these might be useful for implementing <em>Bouncer</em>?</li>
</ol>
<h4>
	Stage 4: Exploder 
</h4>
<p>
	An <em>Exploder</em> should behave just like a <em>Bouncer</em>, except that as it moves/bounces, it also: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li> Step 1: picks a random size between 2 and 10 times its initial size, and slowly grows to that size. </li>
	<li> Step 2: When it reaches that random size, it dies (and hence is no longer in the world, hence is no longer drawn, etc.) </li>
	<li> Step 3: When it reaches that random size, it constructs two new <em>Exploder</em>s, each starting <strong>where the original Exploder died</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>From the UML diagram, what class must <em>Exploder</em> extend?</li>
	<li>What method in the <em>BallEnvironment</em> interface might be useful for &ldquo;killing&rdquo; the old <em>Exploder</em>?</li>
	<li>What behavior does <em>Exploder</em> share with <em>Bouncer</em>?</li>
	<li>Don&rsquo;t duplicate code! Instead, move the shared code for <em>Bouncer</em> and <em>Exploder</em> into <em>AbstractBouncer</em>. </li>
</ol>
<h3>
	Instructions Part 5 - Iteratively extend the behavior 
</h3>
<p>
	The four buttons to create new balls should all work now, as should the button to pause and resume the entire world. In the remaining stages of the project you&rsquo;ll implement mouse-based features for individual balls, including: pause/resume, killing, and dragging. 
</p>
<h4>
	Stage 5: Pause/Resume individual balls 
</h4>
<p>
	When the user clicks a world, the nearest <em>Ball</em> should pause. That is, all motion of the <em>Ball</em> should cease. <em>Pulsar</em>s shouldn&rsquo;t pulse, <em>Mover</em>s shouldn&rsquo;t move, <em>Bouncer</em>s shouldn&rsquo;t bounce, and <em>Exploder</em>s shouldn&rsquo;t explode. Unless the nearest <em>Ball</em> is already paused! In that case, the <em>Ball</em> should resume its normal animation. 
</p>
<ol>
	<li> What class implements both <em>MouseListener</em> and <em>MouseMotionListener</em> (and hence responds to mouse events)? </li>
	<li> The <em>BallWorldComponent</em>&rsquo;s <em>BallWorldMouseHandler</em> responds to a mouse-press by selecting the <em>Ball</em> nearest the mouse (and showing this by turning that <em>Ball</em> cyan while the mouse is pressed). </li>
	<li> The <em>BallWorldMouseHandler</em> responds to a mouse-left-click by telling the selected <em>Ball</em> to toggle between the paused and not-paused state. </li>
	<li>The <em>Temporal</em> interface specifies the methods that <em>BallWorldMouseHandler</em> uses to communicate with the selected <em>Ball</em>. What methods in <em>Ball</em> must you implement or modify to handle pause/resume?</li>
	<li> What other class implements the Temporal interface? You might look at how it implements the required methods for some ideas. </li>
	<li> <strong>You don&rsquo;t need to deal with the mouse directly. The provided code does that for you. For example, <em>setIsPaused()</em> is called on the nearest ball whenever the user clicks the mouse. You just need to properly implement the <em>Temporal</em> interface in Ball and <em>all</em> your balls should pause and resume correctly.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>
	Stage 6: Kill individual balls 
</h4>
<p>
	When the user right-clicks a world, the nearest <em>Ball</em> should be killed. That is, the <em>Ball</em> should disappear, never to be seen again. 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Like for pause/resume, the <em>BallWorldMouseHandler</em> takes care of signalling to the Ball that it should die.</li>
	<li> What method of <em>Temporal</em> should you finish implementing in <em>Ball</em> to kill it? </li>
	<li> What method from <em>BallEnvironment</em> might be useful? </li>
	<li>You should only need to change <em>Ball</em>. All the individual kinds of <em>Ball</em>s should inherit the changed behavior!</li>
</ol>
<h4>
	Stage 7: Handle mouse drags 
</h4>
<p>
	When the user drags on a world, the nearest <em>Ball</em> should move with the mouse. When the user releases the mouse button, the <em>Ball</em> should remain where it was &ldquo;dropped&rdquo; and be paused. (The user can click again to make the <em>Ball</em> resume its animation.) 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Like for pause/resume and dying, the <em>BallWorldMouseHandler</em> takes care of signalling to the <em>Ball</em> that it should move.</li>
	<li> What method of <em>Relocatable</em> should you finish implementing in <em>Ball</em> to make it, well, relocatable? </li>
	<li>You should only need to change <em>Ball</em>. All the individual kinds of <em>Ball</em>s should inherit the changed behavior!</li>
</ol>
<h3>
	Bonus: &ldquo;Implementer&rsquo;s Choice&rdquo; 
</h3>
<p>
	For bonus points, you can design a <em>Ball</em> with its own special properties, extending the appropriate abstract class, or introducing new abstract classes for any shared behavior. You can certainly override methods of <em>Ball</em> to interesting effect. Triangles anyone?
</p>
<p>
	Bonus points will vary from just a couple points for something that basically just copies something else that a ball can do (like just using random colors), up to 20 for something really original, cool-looking, and non-trivial! 
</p>

<!-- 
<p>
	Alternative: it would be really cool to implement bumpers, as shown in the UML diagram. It seems like a real challenge! Hint: you&rsquo;ll need to add a new BallButton somewhere &mdash; look at the UML diagram to figure out which class contains BallButtons.
